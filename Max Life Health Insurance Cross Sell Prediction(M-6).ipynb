The business goal was to identify high-potential customers for targeted marketing, thereby increasing cross-sell conversions and overall revenue.\n","\n","The dataset provided contained over 280,000 records with customer demographic and policy-related information. The problem was framed as a binary classification task where the target variable was whether a customer opted for the health insurance cross-sell product.\n","\n","* Data Preparation and Exploration\n","The initial phase involved extensive data wrangling, including checking for null values, understanding data types, handling outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats using encoding techniques. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns and relationships among variables such as age, vintage, annual premium, policy sales channel, and vehicle damage status.\n","\n","It was observed that certain features like Vintage, Annual Premium, Age, and Vehicle Damage showed significant correlation with the response variable. The dataset also exhibited class imbalance, with only about 12% of customers opting for the cross-sell product. This imbalance was addressed using class weighting techniques within the model.\n","\n","* Model Building and Evaluation\n","Two models were implemented:\n","\n","Decision Tree Classifier\n","\n","Random Forest Classifier\n","\n","Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance while avoiding excessive computational time. Decision Tree was used as a baseline model, and Random Forest was selected for its robustness, ensemble learning advantage, and higher prediction accuracy.\n","\n","Evaluation metrics considered included Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC Score. However, due to the business focus on maximizing customer acquisition opportunities, Recall and ROC AUC Score were prioritized as key metrics.\n","\n","The Random Forest model outperformed the Decision Tree, achieving a ROC AUC Score of 0.85 and a Recall of 93% for the positive class. This ensures the model can effectively identify nearly all potential customers likely to purchase the health insurance cross-sell product.\n","\n","*  Business Impact\n","By deploying this machine learning model, Max Life can significantly improve the effectiveness of its health insurance cross-sell initiatives. The high recall ensures that most of the potential buyers are captured, directly supporting business growth. The model also enables data-driven marketing segmentation, allowing the company to allocate resources efficiently by targeting customers with a high likelihood of conversion."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Write Problem Statement Here.** Max Life Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction"],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "],"metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
