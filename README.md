# 🧠 Max Life Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction

## 📋 Summary

This project aimed to help **Max Life Insurance** improve its cross-selling strategy by predicting which existing health insurance policyholders are most likely to purchase **vehicle insurance**. The dataset included over **280,000 customer records**, covering demographics, vehicle ownership, previous insurance history, and premium details.

The problem was framed as a **binary classification task**, where the target variable indicated whether a customer showed interest in vehicle insurance.

**Industry:** Insurance / Financial Services

## 🧱 Challenges and Solutions

| **Challenge**             | **Solution**                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Highly imbalanced dataset | Used class weighting to ensure minority class importance           |
| Risk of overfitting       | Applied RandomizedSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter tuning       |
| Non-linear relationships  | Implemented Random Forest for better generalization                |
| Large dataset             | Optimized computations with NumPy and vectorized Pandas operations |

## 💡 Actionable Insights

* Customers with **vehicle damage history** were significantly more likely to purchase vehicle insurance.
* **Older customers** and those with **higher annual premiums** showed greater purchase intent.
* **New customers (low vintage)** were less likely to cross-purchase.
* Certain **sales channels** demonstrated higher conversion rates than others.
